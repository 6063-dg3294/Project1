# Book Choice
I chose The Merlin Trilogy as my book. This is a book about a series of three historical fantasy novels that reimagines the Arthurian legend through the perspective of the legendary wizard Merlin. 

## Book Cover
1. I'll include Merlin the wizard in book cover. 
2. Stars (gifs)
3. a beautifu sky
4. Maybe Excalibur the sword
5. It would be interactive, given it's a magic book

## Possible Ideas
I want to explore the visual effects that could be similar to using magic, like mouseClick() and maybe an interactive sword in the stone that can be pulled out.  

I think my idea can be related to the reading that talks about interactive design. I will try to create a visual conversation.
