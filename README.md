# Book Choice
I chose The Merlin Trilogy as my book. This is a book about a series of three historical fantasy novels that reimagines the Arthurian legend through the perspective of the legendary wizard Merlin. 


# Week 2 update
This week I tried to make the sword animation. Somehow it has this feature of lifting to the sky. It is pretty cool, but I'll refine it in the future. Also, I used RGB dots to try to create this sky of stars. For now, I have functions of drawing stars and the sword. For the following week, I would:

1. Use smaller dots to create a high-detailed sky (for loop) - can I use for loop to cover every (1,1) pixels?
2. Create a pixel-style stone to cover up the sword
3. Use color change based on second to do time-based starry sky
4. Create a giant "+" Star in the bg using for loop
5. Use class() to define some decorative elements
6. Create a title using text()




## Book Cover
1. I'll include Merlin the wizard in book cover. 
2. Stars (gifs)
3. a beautifu sky
4. Maybe Excalibur the sword
5. It would be interactive, given it's a magic book

## Possible Ideas
I want to explore the visual effects that could be similar to using magic, like mouseClick() and maybe an interactive sword in the stone that can be pulled out.  

I think my idea can be related to the reading that talks about interactive design. I will try to create a visual conversation.
